# Touch Game

This is an app that display a grid of blocks where the player is challenge to click on the block that is highlighted.
 

### How to build ##
There is only one branch right now, but it could be split in at least 2 if there are more devs on the development. 
So just use Main branch to build it

### Project technical decisions ###
The project was designed following MVVM design pattern.
I am still new with Compose, but I for me it was a better fit to implements the screen changes.

For the implementation was decided to use:
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Kotlin Flow

Designed and developed by Rodrigo Salom√£o
